Know your limits
Under UK pension rules there are limits on the amount of tax-free cash you
can access from your pension plan. The Lump Sum Allowance (LSA) is set
at £268,275.00 and payments above this are subject to tax at your marginal
rate of income tax. If you'd like more details about these allowances, please
visit royallondon.com/pensionallowances.
You've triggered the Money Purchase Annual Allowance (MPAA). The
current MPAA is £10,000.00 each year. If you contribute more than this
into any pension you'll be liable to a tax charge. Please note that within 91
days you must tell any other providers of plans or schemes to which you
contribute, that the MPAA trigger applies to you from 26 November 2025.
Can I change my mind?
You have 30 days from the date of this letter to change your mind. All you
need to do is confirm you'd like to change your mind by writing to us at the
address shown.
